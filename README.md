Hi Everyone!

My name is Laurence and I come from China. I am fifteen years old this year, which means I have to go to the high school.
I like C++ programming, and generally I have learned lots of algorithms and data structures for more than four years.
This year(2018), I got an new interest, that is AI. I am trying to get myself have a better understanding of it before 2019.
Keep going! Hello_World_in_Github
